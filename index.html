            <h2>About this project</h2>

            <h3>Goal and Motivation</h3>

            <p>In most countries, we have grown so accostumed with ubiquitous Internet access through our mobile devices that we barely stop to think about it. This project aims to give a glimpse into the complex and somewhat invisible, mysterious technologies and infrastructure that bring the services and vast amount of information of the Internet to our fingertips.</p>

            <p>To achieve that, our challenge was to make the invisible visible, and for that we chose to use Augmented Reality (AR), a technology for interactive experiences that combine real-world and virtual, computer-generated elements. This is exactly what was needed for the project: in the Interactive Experience that we designer, physical objects come to life virtually through the <strong>advanced interaction</strong> allowed by AR, and <strong>advanced computer graphics</strong> techniques expose layers of information that would otherwise be invisible.</p>

            <p>This project was created by students of the Master's Program in Interactive Media Technology of KTH &mdash; Royal Institute of Tehcnology, for the course <em>Advanced Graphics and Interaction</em>.</p>
